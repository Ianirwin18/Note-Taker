## Description

Build an application that writes and saves notes. This app uses express.js to process all the backend information. For this app I only had to create the backend since the front end was given to me and then connect the two. This app was deployed through Heroku.

## Installation

- Npm install

- view on localhost:3001 or https://notetaker-challenge-11.herokuapp.com/

## Usage

- Press 'âž•' to add a new note
- Delete previously made notes with the red 'ðŸ—‘'
- View already made notes on the left column of the page
